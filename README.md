# Power Play Lineup Optimization for NHL Teams üèí

## Overview
This project uses supervised deep learning models to recommend optimal NHL power play lineups to maximize team expected goals per 60 minutes (xG/60). Models include MLP, CNN, and RNN architectures.

## Objectives
- Maximize expected goals per 60 (xG/60) by optimizing player selection in power play scenarios.
- Leverage advanced NHL player metrics such as CF%, FF%, and GA/60 for informed decision-making.

## Dataset
- Data collected on over 1,100 NHL players.
- Features include:  
  - Expected Goals per 60 (xG/60)  
  - Corsi For % (CF%)  
  - Fenwick For % (FF%)  
  - Goals Against per 60 (GA/60)  
  - And more.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering in Python (Pandas, NumPy).  
- Supervised learning models built using TensorFlow and scikit-learn.  
- Model evaluation through cross-validation and performance metrics.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- TensorFlow  
- scikit-learn  
- Pandas  

## Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance.  
- Explore ensemble learning methods.  
- Potential application to other special teams scenarios (Penalty Kill).
