    "The goal of this model was to predict the **expected goals per 60 minutes (xG/60)** for 5-player power play lineups, based on individual player statistics. A **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** regression model was selected for this task due to its ability to learn complex, nonlinear interactions between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "Each lineup consisted of:\n",
    "- 1 Center\n",
    "- 1 Left Wing\n",
    "- 1 Right Wing\n",
    "- 2 Defensemen\n",
    "\n",
    "The individual features for each player in the lineup were concatenated into a single feature vector. For example, if there were 20 features per player, each input to the model was a 100-dimensional vector (5 players × 20 features).\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was built using TensorFlow and Keras with the following architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input Layer** — Flattened lineup feature vector  \n",
    "- **Dense Layer (256 units)** — ReLU activation  \n",
    "- **Batch Normalization** — Normalize layer output  \n",
    "- **Dropout (0.3)** — Prevent overfitting  \n",
    "- **Dense Layer (128 units)** — ReLU activation  \n",
    "- **Batch Normalization**  \n",
    "- **Dropout (0.3)**  \n",
    "- **Dense Layer (64 units)** — ReLU activation  \n",
    "- **Output Layer (1 unit)** — Linear activation (for xG/60 prediction)\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Training Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)  \n",
    "- **Optimizer:** Adam (learning rate = 0.001)  \n",
    "- **Metrics Tracked:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  \n",
    "- **Epochs:** 100  \n",
    "- **Batch Size:** 32  \n",
    "- **Validation Split:** 20% of training data used for validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained on approximately **100,000 randomly generated lineups** using non-Leafs players (the training set). Input features were standardized using `StandardScaler`.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Evaluation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "After training, the model was used to evaluate **100,000 test lineups** generated from only **Toronto Maple Leafs players**. Each lineup’s predicted xG/60 was calculated, and the model returned:\n",
    "- The **optimal lineup** with the highest predicted xG/60\n",
    "- The **top 10 lineups** overall, ranked by predicted offensive potential\n",

    "###  Model Training Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The model’s training performance was evaluated using two key metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** — measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual xG/60\n",
    "- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** — measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual xG/60\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loss Over Epochs (MSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss plot shows that both the training and validation loss decrease rapidly within the first 15–20 epochs and then plateau at a low value. This indicates that the model quickly learned the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **training loss** steadily decreases and stabilizes\n",
    "- The **validation loss** closely follows the training curve without diverging\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no indication of overfitting, as the validation loss does not increase over time. The final loss values are very low, suggesting that the model is making small errors when predicting xG/60.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MAE Over Epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAE plot tells a similar story. The average error on both the training and validation sets dropped sharply early in training and leveled out below 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The final **validation MAE** remained low and stable\n",
    "- This suggests that the model's predictions are, on average, within **±0.04 xG/60** of the actual values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these results indicate that the model converged quickly and generalizes well. The close alignment of training and validation curves in both MSE and MAE plots shows that the model is not overfitting and maintains good predictive performance on unseen lineups.\n"

    "###  Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model was able to accurately learn patterns in player performance across multiple statistical categories, achieving a low mean absolute error (~0.04) when predicting xG/60 for randomly generated lineups.\n",
    "- Key offensive contributors such as **Auston Matthews**, **Mitch Marner**, and **Michael Bunting** consistently appeared in top-performing lineups, suggesting the model effectively identified high-impact players.\n",
    "- Using players from all NHL teams for training allowed the model to learn generalizable patterns, which transferred well when evaluating combinations specific to the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n",
    "- The use of advanced stats (e.g., xGF%, GF/60) from **Natural Stat Trick** appeared to significantly boost predictive power compared to traditional scoring stats alone.\n",

    "###  Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrated that deep learning, specifically a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**, can be effectively applied to optimize NHL power play lineups using player-level statistics. The model learned to evaluate combinations of players and ranked potential lineups based on expected offensive output (xG/60).\n",
    "\n",
    "By evaluating thousands of possible combinations, the model produced actionable lineup suggestions tailored to a specific team — in this case, the **Toronto Maple Leafs**. This approach offers a scalable and data-driven way to support coaching decisions.\n",

    "###  Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chemistry effects:** Incorporating player pairing history or on-ice synergy data to account for real-world chemistry between players.\n",
    "- **Context-aware modeling:** Introducing game situation variables (e.g., opponent, score differential, zone starts) to make predictions more dynamic.\n",
    "- **Alternative model types:** Testing other deep learning architectures (e.g., recurrent or attention-based models) to capture temporal player trends.\n",
    "- **Reinforcement learning:** Framing the problem as a sequence of decisions (e.g., full game strategy) rather than one-shot lineup optimization.\n",
    "- **Penalty kill modeling:** Applying the same approach to predict optimal defensive lineups and special teams configurations.\n",
